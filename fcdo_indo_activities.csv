Multiple international studies confirm a global consensus that attacks on health often threaten the sanctity of health care, disrespect the right to health care, and violate international humanitarian law. Gathering evidence of attacks has to date been crucial in raising awareness of the issue. But existing evidence is largely restricted to the reporting of incidents and their immediate impact, and falls short of providing data on the longer-term and wider impacts of attacks on healthcare access and utilisation as well as broader public health outcomes. This research will transcend previous work on attacks against healthcare through rigorous new and sustained data collection over the lifetime of the project.

The selected recipients are expected to participate in a mid-term learning review in late 2020 to reflect on their efforts to achieve scaling and research uptake.

One of these recipients is the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA). This project integrates results from CARIAA by supporting three initiatives in South Asia with strong potential for scaling or research uptake for greater impact.

The first initiative focuses on scaling adaptation trials to inform climate financing in Bangladesh. The research will build upon earlier CARIAA results to evaluate the suitability of a set of adaptation options and work with government departments to develop an adaptation funding proposal to invest in and scale promising strategies and increase resilience in coastal Bangladesh. 

The second initiative focuses on reducing the health risks of rising temperatures in India. The team will follow up on CARIAA pilot studies to assess the effectiveness of the first year of India’s heat stress warning campaign. Working with the Indian Meteorological Department, it will prepare tailored heat stress advice for 50 rural villages. 

The third initiative will identify pathways for climate-resilient development in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region. The team will map outcomes, explore the effectiveness of livelihood innovations piloted in four countries under CARIAA, and critically examine the opportunities for scaling, creating climate resilient development pathways, and integrating promising strategies into adaptation planning.

Expected results include contributions to knowledge through peer-reviewed publications, contributions to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report, policy-oriented outputs, and practice through strategic engagement and research-into-use activities. It will also strengthen collaboration amongst the network of researchers previously engaged in CARIAA.

This project integrates results from CARIAA by supporting three initiatives with strong potential for further scaling or uptake of results to achieve greater impact. 

The first initiative will scale up climate adaptation learning and understanding among female-led enterprises in Africa’s semi-arid regions. New research will further investigate the behaviours, barriers, and conditions that hinder or support female-led micro, small, and medium enterprises in Senegal and Kenya. This work will improve the understanding of and support the strategic role that female entrepreneurship has in unlocking broader resilience. 

The second initiative will synthesize results on the migration and adaptation nexus. New work will inform adaptation policymaking to include migration and mobility, contribute to ongoing global initiatives, and develop a future research agenda on migration, mobility, and adaptation. 

The third initiative will synthesize results from research in semi-arid regions in Africa and South Asia. It will map the environmental and economic trajectories of change and explore how select countries could improve alignment between proposed development trajectories and alternative development pathways to deliver more equitable and climate-resilient futures.

Expected results include contributions to knowledge through synthesis reports and peer-reviewed publications, policy reports, briefs, and a position paper on a research agenda; strategic engagement and research-into-use activities to inform policy and practice; and strengthened cross-consortia collaboration amongst the network of researchers previously engaged in CARIAA.

"350","GB-CHC-287287-5489","Bangladesh","skills for Growth: Human Capital Deficits, Labour Market Frictions, and Firm-Level Productivity Frictions in Developing Economies","There is extensive evidence that private firms in developing economies face larger barriers to expanding than firms in advanced economies and that differences in barriers to firm growth manifest in aggregate productivity differences. It is conceivable, however, that productivity differences also result from the lower quality of human  capital employed by firms in less developed economies, as suggested by the        theoretical analysis in Jones (2014). Distinguishing between resource misallocation and skill deficits is of paramount importance for policy, as interventions that would address one problem may not be successful in tackling the other, but progress in this direction has been halted by the lack of suitable data.

This project is therefore implemented in two steps. First, design and collection of a novel worker-level dataset on occupational skills in low- and middle-income countries, that is fully comparable with analogous data sources in high-income countries and is accompanied by firm-level data on production, capital, and intermediate inputs. Second, quantification of the productivity losses that result from differences in the skill content of jobs and from differences in the efficiency of labour allocations across countries, using our novel dataset to inform a general equilibrium model with human capital and frictional labour markets.

Management practices in developing economies are often based on tradition or otherwise obsolete information, and uncertainty is a significant obstacle to firm expansion (Bloom et al., 2013). Access to high-quality data can improve firm-level operational efficiency in LICs. This project responds precisely to the need for accurate and reliable information for improved  decision-making in LICs. The researchers will provide access to reliable skill data and complement the data with detailed statistical and economic analysis to enhance human resource management, training, and hiring practices by both private and public decision-makers.

"351","GB-CHC-287287-6798","Bangladesh","Engaging women in mobile money markets","Women are underrepresented as providers and as users of mobile money services in Bangladesh: there are almost no female agents and as of 2017, the gender gap in account usage stood at 29%. Vandewalle, Gine´ and Goldberg will conduct an RCT to evaluate two interventions that interfere with the supply and demand of mobile financial services for women. The project has three specific objectives. First, the researchers will estimate the differential economic impact of hiring male and female mobile banking agents on workers and on business development. Second, the project allows studying the effect of experiencing female employment on attitudes towards female labour force participation. Finally, they will test whether limited access to female agents forms a gender-specific constraint to being a mobile money customer, to account usage and to taking up loans.

At the supply side, the researchers collaborate with bKash - a major provider of mobile money - to increase the number of women working as mobile money agents. To do so, businesses will receive a subsidy to hire an employee to manage the bKash transactions. The stores will be randomly allocated to one of three groups: control, male employee, or female employee. On the demand side, they will collaborate with BRAC to study the digitisation of microfinance loan repayments by female clients. To do so, BRAC will identify 90 branches that will be randomly allocated to one of three arms: control, voluntary digitisation or mandatory digitisation. Microfinance groups covered by branches in the voluntary digitisation arm will decide whether to reimburse loans in cash or whether they prefer to repay their loans using mobile money. The groups in the control arm will continue reimbursing in cash, and those in the mandatory arm will be required to repay their loans using mobile money. The cross randomisation of these two interventions lets us test whether female agents increase access for female customers.

Improving the effectiveness of financial services targeting women and female micro-entrepreneurs in particular is a key policy question. This reseach can contribute to policymaking in this area in several ways. First, the digitisation of loan reimbursements will naturally increase the pool of women who have mobile money accounts and who gain experience using them. This will positively influence account usage, which the literature shows is economically empowering. This may also impact loan usage by women and influence female led businesses in particular. Second, encouraging the wider employment of women as mobile money agents may create opportunities for other women – and not only for BRAC clients - to use mobile money. Third, the direct employment of women in this project may change attitudes and reduce barriers to female labour force participation.","2021-01-06","2023-06-30",199557,"","","GDP","Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR)","Graduate Institute Geneva","Switzerland","Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA)","Kenya","GB-1-202835","FCDO fully funded","Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","Bangladesh","","Active",2021-06-30,NA,"202835","Private Enterprise Development in Low Income Countries (PEDL)"

Second, we will develop measures of corruption. Third, using the dataset and the measure of corruption we will answer several pressing questions, like (a) do social accountability initiatives work better in states where citizen awareness is high and in programmes which have personal rather than collective benefits for citizens, (b) when top down audits are used, how does the design of audits affect the program's success, and (c) the design of optimal auditing mechanisms.","2019-01-01","2021-09-30",201289,"","","GDP","Global Integrity","King's College London, UK","United Kingdom",NA,NA,"GB-1-203752","FCDO fully funded","Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","India","","Active",2021-06-30,NA,"203752","Anti Corruption Evidence ' ACE' Programme"

Its findings show, among others, that one common management practice – ethics training – does not correlate with lower corruption or more ethical behaviour of civil servants. In response, several governments have asked for guidance on how to design effective ethics training, and evidence on its effects. The extension will provide such evidence. It will survey corruption and (un)ethical behaviour of 1,200 civil servants in Nepal and Bangladesh over time, while providing them with a semester-long state-of-the-art ethics training in a field experiment (RCT).

Older and disabled people are the groups with highest mortality rates from COVID-19. Hygiene-related behaviour change (HBC) programmes must therefore include older and people with disabilities. However, these groups may face challenges protecting themselves from infection (e.g. reliance on carers, lack of accessible information, lower autonomy, lower socio-economic status, and inaccessible sanitation facilities). HBC programmes may need to implement additional activities to reach these groups. Yet, guidance on the inclusion of people with disabilities and older people in COVID-related HBC programmes is still evolving, and practical advice is needed.
The PENDA programme will conduct an action-research project to support FCDO's Hygiene and Behaviour Change Consortium (HBCC) to include people with disabilities and older people in their COVID-19 response.

The initial earthquake and resulting aftershocks triggered over 22,000 landslides across 14 districts of central Nepal. Damage to the hillslopes caused by the earthquakes has led to an increased risk of landslides during subsequent monsoon seasons, and this risk is estimated remains elevated for several years to come.

These cascading hazards impact immediate response and longer-term reconstruction and recovery efforts. Responsible agencies such as the National Reconstruction Agency (NRA) and the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority need accurate information to guide their planning and decision making. The project is monitoring how post-earthquake landslide hazard changes, as loose material is remobilised by monsoon rainfall in order to identify at risk locations. Data has been used to model potential landslide runout to map areas at greater risk of being impacted by landsliding from above.","2018-02-15","2021-11-30",NA,"","","GDP","Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","University of Durham","UK","National Society for Earthquake Technology","Nepal",NA,"FCDO fully funded","Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","Nepal","","Active",2021-06-30,NA,NA,NA

Heart disease and stroke account for nearly one third of all deaths and are a major cause of hospitalization. Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) are at particularly high risk. Clinical trials demonstrate that nearly one third of patients with CHF will experience a myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or hospitalization for CHF. Observational studies have established an association between influenza infection and major adverse vascular events . It follows that vaccinating such a high risk group as patients with CHF against influenza may prevent adverse vascular events. However, these studies are subject to bias and a well designed clinical trial is needed to test the effect of influenza vaccination on preventing adverse vascular events. The goal of this study is to assess whether inactivated influenza vaccine can reduce adverse vascular events in high risk participants. We will address the question by randomizing patients at high risk for adverse vascular events to either annual inactivated influenza vaccine or to placebo over three influenza seasons. The primary outcome is a composite of cardiovascular (CV) death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non- fatal stroke, and hospitalization for CHF. We will enroll 3,500 participants from centres in seven countries: Philippines (the lead centre), Mozambique, Sudan, Uganda, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, China. This proposed randomized trial has important implications for the management of patients at high risk for major adverse vascular events. Although the influenza vaccine is recommended annually for groups with diabetes and cardiovascular disease in many counties, uptake of these recommendations is relatively low. Cardiologists in most jurisdictions do not routinely recommend annual influenza vaccine for their patients as a strategy to reduce future adverse vascular events such as acute coronary syndrome or stroke. Uptake of influenza vaccine in patients with heart disease varies by country but in INTER-CHF sites (where are trial will be conducted) is 11% on average. Rigorous demonstration of influenza vaccine leading to a reduction in major adverse vascular events would represent a landmark study. We anticipate that such a trial would influence management decisions by physicians for patients at high risk for major vascular events. The effect size we propose testing is comparable to secondary prevention strategies available and given the fact that a vaccine is given once annually it is simple and inexpensive. Given the large burden of disease, the possibility to reduce cardiovascular and stroke related death is a compelling argument for this trial. If influenza vaccine is shown to reduce adverse vascular events, it will represent an important change in how prevention of adverse vascular events is thought about.

"461","MR/R006113/1","United Kingdom, United Kingdom, Vietnam, Zimbabwe, Uganda, India","Short enhanced anti-tuberculosis and anti-thrombosis treatment for children with tuberculous meningitis","Children who come into contact with an adult who has tuberculosis (TB) are at a high risk of getting TB themselves. Globally, nearly a million children get TB each year. As well as being at high risk of getting TB, young children are especially prone to getting severe TB, which affects the brain. This is called TB meningitis (or TBM). About one in five children who get TBM die of the disease. Of the children who survive, half will have some kind of disability. As well as this tragedy for the child, there is a large personal and financial cost to families who look after these children, often for many years. Health systems and societies are also affected. 

The World Health Organization currently advises 12 months of treatment for children with TBM. They recommend that children with other sorts of TB have 6 months of treatment. This advice is not based on good quality evidence. Experts have been calling for a study to be done to try to find out if it is safe and effective to treat children with TBM for six months. Halving the treatment time would probably have large benefits for families and health systems. Researchers in South Africa have investigated treating children for six months, by giving them slightly different drugs and at higher doses. This means higher drug concentrations are achieved in the brain. The outcomes for these children seem at least as good as the outcomes in other places where 12 months of treatment are given. However, we cannot be sure if it is safe and effective because it has never been tested in a randomised trial. 

The drug aspirin has been used for many years for fever and pain. It is also known to make the blood clot less readily. It is used widely as a treatment for adults who have had heart attacks or strokes to prevent blood clots. Much of the damage in children with TBM is caused by stroke. Aspirin (in addition to TBM treatment) may help to reduce this damage. Two studies have looked at this issue in children. One study showed that aspirin was beneficial and one showed that it was not. Both studies were quite small and doctors remain unsure whether to use aspirin.

We plan to carry out a randomised trial to answer two questions. 
1) Is it safe and effective to treat children with TBM for 6 months as opposed to 12 months? We plan to see if children treated for 6 months have outcomes that are as good as children treated for 12 months. The children treated for 12 months will receive the currently advised treatment. The children treated for 6 months will receive higher dosages of the drugs and one drug that is different. 
2) Does aspirin reduce the risk of disability in children with TBM? We plan to give half the children aspirin and the other half a placebo (sugar pill) so that neither they nor the study team knows which child is receiving which treatment.

We will monitor all children for side effects. We will also investigate whether these two approaches are acceptable to families and what the financial implications are for both families and for health systems.

We will need about 400 children in the trial to answer these questions. We will carry out the trial in Uganda, Vietnam, Zambia and Zimbabwe. By doing the trial in many different places, we can be confident that any results that we find will be relevant for children all over the world. If either shortening treatment or adding aspirin is safe and effective, the results of this trial could improve how doctors treat children with TBM across the world.","2018-10-01","2022-09-30",3309523,"","","GBP","MRC","University College London","United Kingdom","University of Oxford, Pham Ngoc Thach Hospital, University of Zimbabwe, Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education And Research, Makerere University, Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital, University Teaching Hospital Zambia, Hanoi Lung Hospital","United Kingdom, Vietnam, Zimbabwe, Uganda, India","GB-1-201267","FCDO fully funded","Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","","","Active",2021-07-29,"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=MR/R006113/1","201267","Global Health Clinical Trials Initiative"
"463","MR/S004963/1","Unknown, Indonesia, United Kingdom, Netherlands, South Africa, United States","High Dose Oral Rifampicin to Improve Survival from Adult TB Meningitis - (HARVEST) Trial","Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of tuberculosis (TB). TB meningitis results in death or neurological disability in &gt;50%. The risk of death is more than 2-fold greater in HIV-infected persons. The currently recommended initial treatment regimens for TB meningitis and pulmonary TB are identical, despite that fact that rifampicin penetrates very poorly into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). At the typical rifampicin dose (given at 10mg/kg/day) the concentrations of rifampicin in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) seldom achieve the levels necessary for activity against TB.
 
In a small randomised clinical trial in Indonesia of 60 people, our team found that a higher intravenous dose of rifampicin (13mg/kg) led to a 58% reduction in the hazard of death. A follow-up detailed exposure-response analysis revealed that as the level of rifampicin increased, survival improved. In a second phase II trial of rifampicin given orally at a dose of 30mg/kg/day, the favourable blood and CSF drug exposure and survival benefit were confirmed. Based on the exposure-response analysis we believe a &gt;3-fold increase in rifampicin dose is needed to achieve the CSF levels that correlate with better outcomes. This may explain why an oral rifampicin dose of 15 mg/kg evaluated in a large phase III trial in Vietnam did not show any survival benefit overall, although improved survival was seen in individuals with TB resistant to isoniazid. 

Data from all these international studies have recently been combined and analysed in a detailed model by our team that has led to our conviction that a flat dose of 1500mg for Asian or 1800mg for Africans will produce rifampicin exposures that correlate with improved outcomes. A phase III study is the rational next step. Based on these studies and pharmacokinetic modelling, we propose to evaluate a 3.5-fold higher oral dose of rifampicin in a double-blinded randomised phase III clinical trial in 600 adult TB meningitis patients in Indonesia, Uganda, and South Africa. In order to simplify future implementation, we have chosen a single (flat) high rifampicin dose for all patients (1500mg in Indonesia and 1800mg in Uganda/South Africa, corresponding to ~35mg/kg), to be administered during the first 8 weeks of treatment. All patients will receive three other first-line TB drugs, standard adjuvant steroids, and anti-retroviral treatment as indicated. The primary outcome will be 6-month mortality. Additionally, we will also evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the new Xpert MTB/Rif Ultra for diagnosis of TB meningitis while screening patients for this trial. 
 
We expect that a high dose of rifampicin could be implemented broadly and quickly to the benefit of many TB meningitis patients, considering that the drug is widely available at low cost and its properties are known to clinicians all over the world. To confirm this we will carefully examine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention as well as factors relating to the optimal implementation of high dose rifampicin for TB meningitis patients. We expect this trial (if successful) to change the worldwide standard of care for the treatment of TB meningitis.","2019-06-01","2023-05-31",3881422,"","","GBP","MRC","Infectious Diseases Institute Limited","Unknown","Bandung Islamic University, London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine, Radboud University Nijmegen, University of KwaZulu-Natal, University of Minnesota","Indonesia, United Kingdom, Netherlands, South Africa, United States","GB-1-201267","FCDO fully funded","Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","","","Active",2021-07-29,"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=MR/S004963/1","201267","Global Health Clinical Trials Initiative"

Rainfall and earthquakes are the main triggers of these landslides. Poor land management practices (e.g., deforestation, slash &amp; burn cultivation, haphazard mining and heavy tilling in agriculture), coupled with increased development and poor settlement location have increased vulnerability of communities in these areas to landslides. 

The impact of landslides on people, business, culture and heritage can be considerable and wide-ranging, including fatalities, loss of agricultural land and infrastructure, and damage to ecosystems. To build resilience to landslides in these vulnerable communities (a key aim of SHEAR), a root and branch evaluation of human interactions with landslide prone environments, and improved knowledge of the 'physical' processes is required. Developing approaches to integrate weather, landscape and social-dynamic models is fundamental to building an effective hydrologically-controlled landslide early warning system (EWS). 

LANDSLIP will develop new insights by building on existing scientific research in India, the UK and Italy and using interdisciplinary methodologies and perspectives. Due to complex environmental conditions and triggering processes that cause landslides, the extent and variability of spatial &amp; temporal scales means that landslides are inherently difficult to forecast and manage at site, slope, catchment and regional spatial scales and hourly to decadal temporal scales. LANDSLIP will address this by doing research to understand weather regimes (previously not done in S Asia) and rainfall characteristics that trigger landslides and geomorphological/geological control factors that can enhance landslide susceptibility. Knowledge of where and when historic landslides have occurred and under what environmental conditions, will also be collated and analysed, drawing on extensive consortium experience of developing and managing landslide inventories and impact libraries.

An innovative challenge we address in LANDSLIP is how slope and site specific EWS inform wider catchment to national landslide EWS and how early warning information from medium-range forecasts supplement and enhance short-term (day to a week) forecasting approaches. 

A further innovative aspect of LANDSLIP is improving EWS effectiveness through integrating social dynamics information gathered from both 'Human' (i.e. social media) and physical sensors (remote sensing and pre-existing site-specific wireless networks deployed by AMRITA). LANDSLIP will develop ways of utilising these sources of information to supplement existing inventories and enhance EW information for decision makers. 

Our programme will operate in partnership with decision makers, in public and private sectors, academics and non-for profit agencies to achieve an overarching aim of contributing to better landslide risk assessment and early warning, in a multi-hazard framework in India, aiming to increase resilience and reduce loss. Tools and services, focussed on a web map interface, will be developed in conjunction with local scientists, decision makers and communities to improve resilience to hydrologically-controlled landslides in India, specifically using two pilot study areas; Darjeeling-East Sikkim in the Himalaya and Nilgiris in the Western Ghats. We will ensure knowledge transfer to other vulnerable communities by assessing how they can be applied, remotely, in Afghanistan.

GLOFs and landslide dam-burst floods, jointly termed natural dam-burst floods (NDBFs), have been recognised as one of the most serious natural hazards in populated mountainous regions across the globe. Of all South Asia countries, Nepal is subject to some of the highest national-level socio-economic impacts from natural dam-burst floods (NDBFs), threatening thousands of people, hundreds of villages and basic infrastructure downstream. Therefore, it is imperative that a national capacity is developed for increasing awareness, early warning, and risk mitigation for NDBFs. Although the Nepalese Government has been actively seeking to reduce and mitigate the NDBF risks, effective early warning and risk mitigation strategies are still lacking across the country. Early warning systems have recently been developed and implemented in various global locations for NDBFs. However, the potential of the latest remote sensing and high-performance flood modelling technologies has yet to be adequately explored and exploited in the existing NDBF monitoring and early warning systems.

In short, there is an urgent societal need to develop reliable NDBF hazard risk assessment, forecasting and warning tools to improve preparedness and build resilience at the community level; and there is a clear research gap in exploiting the latest monitoring and modelling technologies to support practical NDBF risk mitigation applications. To meet the societal need and fill the current research gap, the overarching aim of WeACT is to exploit recent contemporary advances in EO and high-performance dam-break flood modelling to innovate a web-based NDBF hazard assessment and forecasting system to improve community flood preparedness and resilience in Nepal. Although the proposed project has a focus case study in Nepal (the 3,400 km2 Sun Kosi catchment), the developed methods and tools will be transferable to other mountainous countries in South Asia or cross the globe that are suffering from NDBFs.","2018-11-01","2022-03-31",252891,"","","GBP","NERC","Loughborough University","United Kingdom","Government of Nepal, Kathmandu University","Nepal","GB-1-201884","FCDO fully funded","Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","","","Active",2021-07-29,"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=NE/S005919/1","201884","SHEAR - Science for Humanitarian Emergencies and Resilience"
"467","MR/R020396/1","United Kingdom, India","A randomised controlled trial to compare two different doses of maternal B12 supplementation in improving infant B12 deficiency and neurodevelopment","Vitamin B12, also called cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin that has a key role in the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system. Up to 74% women are reported deficient during antenatal period in some populations. Deficiency of B12 in newborns is problematic given the role Vitamin B12 plays in neuronal health (brain and nerve cells health) and in the development of foetal and infant brain. We propose this research to compare two different doses (a treatment dose in comparison with a dose known to just prevent further deficiency) of maternal Vitamin B12 supplementation in terms of their effectiveness in removing infant B12 deficiency and neurodevelopment.
We propose to undertake a multi-centric trial in India and Nepal as these are countries where high incidence of deficiency is reported. We will recruit 720 pregnant women from the antenatal clinics of the department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics at Sitaram Bhartia institute of Science and Research, New Delhi and Paropakar Indrarajayalaxmi Maternity Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal. The subjects will be recruited at their first presentation to the antenatal clinic and should be vegetarian as they are at high-risk of B12 deficiency. Mothers who are &gt;35 years of age, are already on B12 supplementation, have multiple gestation, chronic medical conditions, known psychological illnesses or those who anticipate moving out of the city before/after delivery will be excluded from the study. Recruited mothers will be randomly allocated to 2 equal groups (360 each). Group 1 (Intervention) will receive daily 250 micrograms Vitamin B12 supplementation to the mother through pregnancy and up to 6 months post-partum. Group 2 (Control) will receive 50 micrograms Vitamin B12 supplementation to the mother through pregnancy and up to 6 months post-partum. The profile information of the mother including age, height, weight, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic status, maternal dietary assessment (by Food Frequency Questionnaire), intake of any supplements (iron, folate, Vitamin-D) etc. will be recorded. Vitamin B12 dosage will be provided at enrolment and then monthly to mothers. Mother's blood levels for Vitamin B12 status and other deficiencies will be drawn. Sampling for these biochemical tests will be combined with other routine tests at these stages to avoid any additional discomfort for the mother. 
At childbirth, the delivery and post-delivery course of the new-born will be monitored and documented for any problems potentially influencing neurodevelopment. After discharge, all neonates will be routinely followed with preventive and vaccination care as per standard protocols. During routine visits, anthropometric measurements including weight, length and head circumference will be recorded and signs of micronutrient deficiency (especially anaemia and rickets) will be noted. Any illnesses suffered by the child in the intervening period will be recorded. Supplementation of the mother in both groups will be stopped at 6 months after childbirth followed by evaluation at 9 months. The neurodevelopmental assessment and home environment assessment will be done by a developmental therapist and complementary feeding assessment by a nutritionist. Along with routine sampling for Hb screening at 9 months, infant B12 levels status will be determined. The assessment of the infant neurodevelopment scores, the biochemical measures of B12 status of the infant and those of the mother will then be compared between the two groups to see if the neurodevelopment and/or B12 status in the group receiving the higher dose (250 mcg) is better and safe. A positive or a negative result will generate scientific evidence on whether B12 should be supplemented in vegetarian pregnant women with a view to preventing B12 deficiency and its neurodevelopmental consequences in the infant. This will also allow the development of policies and frameworks for routine/wider usage of this supplement in high-risk populations","2018-10-01","2022-09-30",359463,"","","GBP","MRC","University College London","United Kingdom","Paropakar Maternity and Women's Hospital, Public Health Foundation of India, Sitaram Bhartia Inst of Science & Res","India","GB-1-202766","FCDO fully funded","Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","","","Active",2021-07-29,"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=MR/R020396/1","202766","Global Research Partnership Programme (GRP)"
"469","MR/R020485/1","United Kingdom, India","Comprehensive Anaemia Programme and Personalized Therapies (CAPPT)","Anaemia means that there are fewer red blood cells than normal in the blood or there is less haemoglobin than normal in each red blood cell. In either case, a reduced amount of oxygen is carried around in the bloodstream. Lack of iron is the most common cause of anaemia. This is called iron-deficiency anaemia. Iron deficiency anaemia during pregnancy is a huge problem in low and middle-income countries such as Nepal and India.
It is important to prevent anaemia in pregnancy due to the complications that are associated with low iron levels. Pregnant women who are anaemic are much more likely to die during childbirth than those women who are not and their infants are much more likely to be born small for gestational age.

A rise in haemoglobin during pregnancy is associated with improved outcomes. It is, therefore, imperative that a focus is placed on improving anaemia in pregnant women, especially in low and middle-income countries. 

During pregnancy, women are particularly prone to becoming anaemic and it is a time when eating more iron than normal is recommended. Even then, oral supplements of iron are often still needed in order to prevent anaemia. Despite oral supplementation being recommended by both the Governments of India and Nepal, levels of anaemia remain alarmingly high. Compliance about taking medication may be an issue but other factors such cultural and social beliefs, access to iron rich food sources, other micronutrient deficiencies and inequalities to sharing and access to food in the household are also significant reasons why women remain anaemic. 

This project is designed to address some of these issues by trialling a home based intervention that provides education, counselling and advice about anaemia, good food practises and provides a mechanism of behaviour change for barriers women face in improving their health during pregnancy. A health worker will attend the family home early in pregnancy to deliver this package of care and test haemoglobin levels so that tailored oral iron supplements can be initiated. A subsequent visit at around 22 weeks will reinforce practises and allow for further assessment of haemoglobin. Access to participatory women's group will further reinforce the messages and access to support. The aim of this intervention is an improved haemoglobin level at 28 weeks of pregnancy in this intervention group, when compared with a group of pregnant women who continue to have routine antenatal care. Those women whose anaemia becomes worse despite uptake of intervention and oral supplements, will be offered a blood test to investigate their condition more extensively and assess if there is a genetic reason why they may not respond to the current treatment. This would enable us to identify groups of women who would require a different intervention. This study is innovative in its home based and tailored approach. It is robust in its study design and has experts from many fields working in India, Nepal and the UK.

The overarching aim of this study is to provide robust evidence that the proposed intervention is feasible and works. By carrying it out in two countries with a large number of participants we hope to be able to show that the intervention works in different populations and is adaptable to the needs and variation across different groups. This enhances the prospect that it could be rolled out in different parts of the world most affected by the problem. We plan to work closely with international aid agencies and Governmental organisations within Nepal and India to enact change at a national level. Much thought has been put into the scalability of and cost of the intervention and will continue as we run the trial. This will maximise the potential to roll out the intervention rapidly at a national level if we find that in pregnant women, haemoglobin improves in response to the intervention.","2018-11-01","2021-10-31",803597,"","","GBP","MRC","University College London","United Kingdom","All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Health Research And Social Development Forum","India","GB-1-202766","FCDO fully funded","Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","","","Active",2021-07-29,"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=MR/R020485/1","202766","Global Research Partnership Programme (GRP)"
"471","ES/P005349/1","United Kingdom, India","Can schools' accountability for learning be strengthened from the grassroots? Investigating the potential for community-school partnerships in India","Our project explores the potential of community based accountability relationships to raise children's foundational learning outcomes, with a focus on the most disadvantaged primary-school learners: namely those who are from poorer households and, within these, girls. We ask both whether and how changes occur when school actors are supported to view their accountability as being primarily to their local community and their goal as being to raise all children's learning. To do this, we evaluate a grassroots intervention that supports school actors to work directly with their communities to develop a shared understanding of children's learning levels, collaborate in planning how to raise them, and facilitate action both inside and outside the classroom. In addition to analysing changes in children's learning, we will examine the intervention's capacity to create changes in school-community relations, and teachers' attitudes perceptions, and actions in the classroom.

The intervention builds on two of Pratham's grassroots literacy campaigns to incorporate school-community accountability relationships. Lakhon mein Ek (LME) was primarily an information campaign, supporting communities to undertake and discuss their own independent assessments of children's learning outcomes. Reading Week (RW) provided community volunteers with packages of simple materials with which to work with children to improve their foundational literacy and numeracy skills. The proposed intervention, which we call LME+, seeks to enhance the impact of these previous interventions by working directly with school actors to help them engage and work with their local communities. 

Our theory of change holds that participation of school actors in LME+ will facilitate their understanding of the problem of inadequate foundational learning and therefore their willingness to use LME+ methods, materials and approaches - or their equivalent - in their own practice. Further, it posits that school actors' engagement with the problem will also lead them to successfully negotiate permission to implement new methods, materials and/or teaching activities aimed at improving children's foundational learning. By altering the nature of school actors' engagement with communities and practice within schools, we theorise that LME+ has the potential to rebalance systems of accountability at the local level towards a greater focus on learning outcomes.

In order to investigate the impact of the intervention, we propose to undertake an experimental approach based on mixed research methods. We will first select a state with moderate to high amenability towards new learning initiative, and within this state we will then sample a random selection of 400 villages with 2 or more government schools in each village. The selection of relative large villages is necessary to increase the sample size and maintain low costs. The focus on government schools is important because these are the institutions where the most marginalized children are enrolled. 150 villages (300 schools) will be selected for the LME+ intervention; 125 villages (250 schools) for the original LME &amp; RW intervention and 125 villages (250 schools) as controls. Using varied data collection tools, such as foundational learning assessments, background information, perceptions and attitudes of school actors, classroom observations, interviews with key stakeholders, and monitoring of participation, the aim is to construct reliable counterfactuals that enable us to identify the overall impact of the intervention on learning outcomes and on school actors' attitudes and perceptions, and also to assess whether these impacts are conditional on changes within the school. We also investigate the processes underlying such changes and the potential of this approach to realign the objectives of government educational institutions, schools and communities towards raising learning outcomes using 6 villages as case studies.","2018-01-08","2022-03-06",663275,"","","GBP","ESRC","University of Cambridge","United Kingdom","Government of Uttar Pradesh","India","GB-1-204324","FCDO fully funded","Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","","","Active",2021-07-29,"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=ES/P005349/1","204324","Raising Learning Outcomes (RLO)"

Section 21 of The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE) in India calls for the establishment of a School Development and Management Committee (SMC) consisting of teachers, parents and guardians of children and elected representatives within the concerned local area; a minimum 75% of the SMC are required to be parents/guardians (of which 50% must be women) with proportionate representation from disadvantaged groups e.g. scheduled castes and tribes and minority religions. The SMC monitors the working of the school, prepares and recommends the School Development Plan and monitors the utilization of grants received from the appropriate government or any other source. In practice, parents especially those who belong to scheduled castes/tribes and minorities) are passive participants and rarely exercise voice within the SMC and tend to be dominated by Head Teachers of the concerned Schools. 
In this project, we will, first, develop a conceptual framework (use insights from education research, behavioural economics and game theory. to examine, both theoretically and empirically, how poverty, marginalization and exclusion (collectively referred to as &quot;disadvantage&quot;) impact on the beliefs and agency of parents. This will help us understand in detail the mechanism explaining the passive participation and lack of voice in the accountability processes within their local schools, which potentially amplify, across generations, the disadvantage imposed by disadvantage. 
Second, we will collect evidence, combining both quantitative (baseline/endline surveys, Randomized Control Trials (RCT)) and qualitative methods (focus groups, semi-structured interviews), on the potential impact of a pro-poor accountability framework. The baseline survey will lead to a Citizen Report Card+ (CRC+ which includes an analysis of supply side constraints as well) and the Community Score Card (CSC) (both pioneered by the Public Affairs Centre (PAC), our collaborators). The fieldwork will implement and evaluate a training programme (based on &quot;Reflect&quot; and &quot;Reflect!on Act!on&quot;, developed by Action Aid ) to encourage active participation and critical engagement by disadvantaged groups. 
The project will examine whether such a programme (a) impacts positively on the beliefs, aspirations and agency of parents belonging to poor marginalised communities (scheduled castes/tribes and minorities) in certain districts in rural Northern Karnataka , (b) results in their active, critical engagement within the SMC, and (c) improves the educational/learning outcomes of their children (both boys and girls). 
The starting point of our project is the following observation: although parents belonging to disadvantaged groups may be aware of their rights, they may lack confidence and be pessimistic about their ability to influence the system even if they were to take an active role in an accountability process which impacts on the education outcomes of their children. When a critical threshold of active participation is required for an accountability process to be effective but such participation is costly, such beliefs could lead to an outcome of the underlying collective action problem where nobody exercises their formal rights of participation, thus contributing to the low educational outcomes of their children. 
To the best of our knowledge, our project would constitute the first randomized control trial (RCT) evaluation of a Reflect program and we will be able to identify the causal effect of this interventions on empowerment and accountability.","2018-03-01","2022-02-28",572791,"","","GBP","ESRC","University of Glasgow","United Kingdom","IFMR Graduate School of Business","India","GB-1-204324","FCDO fully funded","Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","","","Active",2021-07-29,"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=ES/P005810/1","204324","Raising Learning Outcomes (RLO)"
"473","MR/P013996/1","United Kingdom, Indonesia, Canada","Making health financing work for the poor: An evaluation of equity in health systems financing in Indonesia","Concerns about the poor and most vulnerable not getting adequate access to quality health care are widespread in low and middle income countries (LMICs) and have led to an intense advocacy for universal health coverage (UHC) in the last 5 years. Effective implementation of UHC requires equity in health care, defined as payment for health services according to capacity to pay and the receipt of benefits according to need. Indonesia has in recent years embarked on a programme to achieve UHC through a national health insurance scheme (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional - JKN). However, with coverage currently at 65% and the 2019 goal for full coverage fast approaching, a second wave of JKN reforms are being planned to bolster Indonesia's progress.

The primary aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the combined effects of a second phase (2017-2019) of JKN-reforms in Indonesia and provide an overall assessment of progress toward the achievement to UHC. The reforms are designed to address factors currently hindering the effective implementation of the national health insurance scheme and in turn the pursuit of UHC by 2019. Over the next 3 years the government will be initiating and strengthening a number of important reforms ranging from re-structuring provider payment schemes through to socialization campaigns to raise awareness of the scheme and its benefits. Strategies for increasing fiscal space for health through increasing tobacco tax and the phasing out of subsidies on fuel are also proposed. Understanding the equity impact of these reforms and how they may (or may not) be facilitating progress towards UHC is of considerable interest to the government of Indonesia. 

The study will take a 'whole of system' approach by integrating both the public and the increasingly important private sector of the Indonesian health care system. Using a before and after design, the impact of these UHC reforms will be measured according to three key outcomes: (i) the progressivity of the health care financing system (ii) the pro-poorness of the health care delivery system and (iii) self-reported health outcomes across socioeconomic groups. The quantitative tools of financing and benefit incidence analysis will be used to assess who pays and who benefits from health care spending at baseline (2017) and 2 years into implementation (end 2019). The study will bring together an international research team consisting of those with substantial experience of evaluating UHC-reforms in Africa and the Asia-Pacific and those with an in-depth understanding of the Indonesian health care system. Qualitative studies to document the context pre and post UHC reforms, and the process of implementing UHC reforms will also be undertaken. Stakeholder analysis will be used to support the translation of priority financing reforms identified through the evaluation into viable policy proposals.

The study will advance methods in this field by testing different indicators and indexes of 'need', against which the appropriateness of the distribution of benefits from using health services can be assessed. The study will also advance knowledge through a better understanding of the contribution of the private sector to meeting the needs of the poor and in turn, inform through the stakeholder analysis, ongoing discussions about effective engagement with private sector to strengthen progress towards UHC.

The over-arching goal of this study is to strengthen the healthcare system of Indonesia through more equitable and sustainable health financing policies. As the fourth most highly populated country in the world, with a total population of around 255 million people, the implications of this study's findings for the design of a universal health system will be far-reaching.","2017-02-01","2021-12-31",721603,"","","GBP","MRC","London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","United Kingdom","University of Indonesia, International Health Economics Association, Government of Indonesia","Indonesia, Canada","GB-1-300346","FCDO fully funded","Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","","","Active",2021-07-29,"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=MR/P013996/1","300346",NA
"475","MR/R00370X/1","United Kingdom, United Kingdom, Uganda, India","Understanding health system linkages: Formative research to develop strategies to support quality improvement in treatment in the private sector","Prompt antibiotic therapy for an infected patient can make the difference between cure and death or long-term disability. Unfortunately, all around the world, some infections are becoming resistant to the antibiotic medicines used to treat them. This could lead to a future scenario in which illnesses last longer, deaths increase, and the cost of treatment rises. Under this scenario, the greatest impacts are likely to be felt in low-income countries where infectious diseases are most common and many families lack financial security. Antibiotic resistance is now considered to be one of the biggest threats to global health. The World Health Organization has called for urgent action, research and investment to counter this threat, through the development of new antimicrobial drugs and through more responsible use of existing drugs. In September 2016, global leaders met at the UN General Assembly - only the fourth time in the history of the UN that a health topic was discussed at the General Assembly - to call for concerted action by every national government to limit the development and spread of drug resistance.

Poor prescription practices by health workers, such as overuse of drugs, sale of partial doses, or non-adherence by patients to the full treatment course, all create situations which are conducive to the selection and spread of resistant mutations. Health workers and pharmacists can help tackle resistance by only dispensing antibiotic drugs when they are truly needed; and by prescribing the right drug in the right quantities to treat the illness. Improving the use of antibiotic medicines thus ultimately involves guiding the treatment decisions made by health workers and patients to discourage indiscriminate use. Therefore, if effective intervention strategies are to be developed, better knowledge and understanding of the factors that influence the prescribing practices of health workers will be essential.

The private sector plays an important role in provision of health care in many African countries, with many patients seeking care from private clinics and drug shops, and cannot be overlooked in strategies to control misuse of antibiotics. Neither can treatment practices and standards be addressed by focusing on one sector in isolation. The private sector interacts with, and is shaped by the organisation and performance of the public sector, demand from patients and regulatory controls. Poor practices in one sector can easily undermine or disincentivize behavioural change in another. Yet regulation of the private sector is an acknowledged weakness of the health system in many low income countries. 

The proposed research aims to address this challenge. We shall investigate the situations, norms, experiences, and motivations that affect health care practices in private clinics and drug shops in rural Uganda, including the influence of interactions between private providers, government health workers and public health officials, in order to generate improved understandings of how the health system can more effectively control treatment practices, and improve the quality of care that patients receive from private providers. 

We intend to use the knowledge and insights gained from this research to develop a comprehensive intervention strategy to improve patient care and combat irresponsible use of antibiotics in private clinics and drug shops in Uganda. This intervention strategy will be tested in future studies. We hope that our findings will also be of value to Ministries of Health and national governments in other low-income countries, and can be used to help inform the development of national plans to counter the threat of antimicrobial resistance.","2017-07-01","2021-12-31",200665,"","","GBP","MRC","London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","United Kingdom","London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine, Makerere University, Universidad Antonio Nariño, University of Glasgow, Royal Veterinary College, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, West Bengal University of Animal and Fishery Sciences","United Kingdom, Uganda, India","GB-1-300346","FCDO fully funded","Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","","","Active",2021-07-29,"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=MR/R00370X/1","300346",NA
"476","MR/S013598/1","United Kingdom, Uganda, United Kingdom, India","A multi-stakeholder approach towards operationalising antibiotic stewardship in India's pluralistic rural health system.","In this study we seek to develop a stewardship intervention that addresses two major interrelated challenges that India faces: increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and a pluralistic health system with a large and unregulated informal health sector. AMR is high on India's policy agenda as it has one of the highest burdens of bacterial infections in the world and is also one of the world's biggest consumers of antibiotics (ABs) for human health. One of the major causes of increasing AMR is the excessive use of ABs in humans, animals and the environment. 
A majority of healthcare providers in rural India, where 68% of the population lives, do not have a formal medical qualification but they fulfil a need for proximate healthcare that the formal health sector has not been able to fill. They are the first contact providers for a variety of illnesses, who frequently and inappropriately treat with ABs. Some states in India, including West Bengal, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh are implementing programmes of training and integrating informal providers (IPs) but evaluations suggest that providers' use of antibiotics has proven difficult to change. We conducted a study in 2016-17 (funded by HSRI Call 3) in rural West Bengal to understand the social, economic and behavioural drivers of antibiotic use (ABU) by IPs in order to address the root causes and develop tailored solutions. We found that the key drivers lay beyond IPs' individual economic needs and knowledge gaps. There was a strong influence of the pharmaceutical industry's aggressive marketing of antibiotics, and the regulatory and health systems had limited resources and capacity to provide stewardship in this health market. Although IPs' integration had initially been opposed by the Indian Medical Association at present there were mutually supportive relationships between informal providers and formal doctors (both public and private) on an individual level. IPs learned from formal doctors who have also been found to prescribe inappropriately. Other drivers were communities' low awareness about the long term dangers of inappropriate antibiotic use, and low purchasing power for full courses. We found that about a quarter of the IPs also treated animals, typically with the same antibiotics as humans. To contain antimicrobial resistance (AMR), we need to work collectively with these diverse stakeholders to arrive at solutions through deliberations and consensus. In this study we propose to co-design an intervention with multiple stakeholders to serve as an effective model of antibiotic stewardship and health systems strengthening at this level.
We will start with formative research in two rural locations in district South 24 Parganas in West Bengal (where our previous study was located) to supplement the data that we have collected in our earlier study. During this phase we will explore antibiotic use with animals in more detail, map the pharmaceutical supply and value chains for human and animal ABU, conduct a stakeholder analysis, map community platforms for behavioural communication and conduct a secondary data review of local AMR prevalence.
This will be followed by an intervention development phase where we will work with key stakeholders identified through the stakeholder analysis using 'Deliberative Mapping', a participatory methodology used with multiple stakeholders for democratic decision making. The intervention options that arise from this process will be further developed and piloted with a small group of providers, about 20 in each site. Evaluation will consist of a feasibility analysis of what worked and did not work, any changes in antibiotic use by IPs (IP and patient exit interviews), and analysis of the actions and reactions of stakeholders during the co-design phase to provide systematic learning to support the design of strategies for strengthening stewardship at scale in future, both in India as well as in similar settings in South Asia and Africa.","2019-02-01","2022-01-31",779322,"","","GBP","MRC","London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","United Kingdom","Makerere University, Universidad Antonio Nariño, University of Glasgow, Royal Veterinary College, West Bengal University of Animal and Fishery Sciences","Uganda, United Kingdom, India","GB-1-300346","FCDO fully funded","Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","","","Active",2021-07-29,"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=MR/S013598/1","300346",NA
"477","MR/K006924/1","United Kingdom, United Kingdom, Cambodia, Thailand, Singapore","Developing and evaluating a framework for the rational design of antibiotic prescribing policies in resource-constrained hospital settings","When hospitalised patients have a serious bacterial infection, they are usually given antibiotics. In rich countries, one third of the time the antibiotics are ineffective. This is often because the bacteria have acquired a gene that makes them resistant to that antibiotic. While it is possible to test for such resistance, it takes three or four days to get a result. For patients with serious infections this delay can be the difference between life and death.

In lower income countries the same is likely to be true, but little data are available. We do, however, know that patients in hospitals in poorer countries get infections more often and when they do they are more likely to die. Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are also a major problem. As well as delaying effective treatment, such resistance can claim lives in low-income settings because remaining effective antibiotics are not available. Even if they are, they may be too expensive for many patients. The research aims to address the question of how we can more often give patients effective antibiotics when they need them and less often when they don't in hospitals with limited resources. We also want to find out how different antibiotics affect the spread of the most dangerous antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and we want to see if by changing patterns of antibiotic prescribing we can reduce the number of infections with resistant bacteria.

One part of the proposed work will use patient data (age, time in hospital, date last hospitalised, etc) and look for patterns that help to predict how likely infections with different types of bacteria are. For example, we know that patients who have been in hospital a long time are more likely to have infections with resistant bacteria. We can use this information to help choose which antibiotic is most likely to be effective. Our hunch is that by using computer models we can make optimal use of the information and choose an effective antibiotic more often than currently happens.

The second consideration doctors have to take into account when prescribing antibiotics is how this will affect other patients. The reason is that the more an antibiotic is used the more it creates an environment favourable to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In general, increasing antibiotic use is associated with increased resistance to that antibiotic. The specifics, however, are complicated: some antibiotics promote resistance much more than others, and sometimes use of one antibiotic can cause an increase in resistance against a completely different antibiotic. To help design good antibiotic policies we need to understand these complex mechanisms better. Another part of the work will therefore use a computer modelling approach and new statistical techniques to develop and apply better methods to understand how levels of resistance change in response to changing antibiotic use. 

The next stage of the research will combine these computer models and make extensive use of expertise from infectious disease doctors to design the best antibiotic policy we can for two hospitals. We will evaluate new policies in two ways: first we will run computer simulations, using real data from the hospitals to predict how well the new policy performs. If it performs worse than current practice we will redesign the policy until it performs better. Then, in one of the hospitals, we will perform an intervention study where we introduce the new policy and evaluate whether it really does improve antibiotic prescribing and reduce resistance as predicted.

Finally, use of new rapid tests that help determine what type of bugs are causing an infection can mean a patient has more chance of getting effective antibiotic treatment when it is needed and less chance of unnecessary treatment. We will use the previously-developed computer models to estimate how much patients would benefit from such tests, and evaluate which would represent good value for money.","2013-03-01","2021-12-31",2044180,"","","GBP","MRC","University of Oxford","United Kingdom","University of Oxford, Angkor Hospital for Children, Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health, National University of Singapore, Wellcome Trust, Hospital Ramón y Cajal","United Kingdom, Cambodia, Thailand, Singapore","GB-1-300347","FCDO fully funded","Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","","","Active",2021-07-29,"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=MR/K006924/1","300347",NA

Infectious diseases, including malaria, HIV, tuberculosis (TB) and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), remain a main focus of our research, as they are the leading causes of ill-health in Africa. In the next grant period, we will expand our research on emerging diseases, adolescent health and non-communicable diseases - particularly hypertension, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which are major disease problems in LMICs. Our research focuses on conditions that are major causes of ill-health, and for which improved prevention or treatment leads directly to improved economic and social outcomes. The importance of these issues to the UK is highlighted in the 2015 Government strategy for overseas aid, on tackling global challenges in the national interest.

The scale-up of malaria control tools, primarily long-lasting insecticidal nets, and effective combination therapies, has prevented an estimated 663 million clinical malaria cases in sub-Saharan Africa since 2000, and has made malaria elimination an achievable goal in some countries. However, these gains may be threatened by insecticide resistance, drug-resistance, and resource-constraints. Within the next grant period, our focus will be on evaluating new tools, combining new and existing control strategies, and investigating sustainable and more effective deployment of these strategies. 

For HIV, we focus on the goal that 90% of those living with HIV know their status, 90% of known HIV-positive individuals receive sustained ART, and 90% of individuals on ART have durable viral suppression. For example, we are leading a major trial in South Africa and Zambia to evaluate the impact of a combination prevention intervention on new cases of HIV in the community. The intervention includes household-based HIV testing and linkage-to-health services by community care providers, and immediate initiation of treatment delivered through routine healthcare services.

TEG research on TB includes studies to evaluate improved TB treatment strategies, improved diagnosis, prevention and control of drug-resistant TB, improved TB case finding and prevention, and evaluation of structural interventions (social support and monetary incentives) to control TB. For example, we are working on a trial to evaluate an improved electronic medication device for TB patients to reduce treatment failure and subsequent recurrence/retreatment in the absence of directly observed treatment.

We will continue our long-standing work on intervention strategies for the control and elimination of NTDs, and our more recent involvement in the control of outbreaks such as the Ebola and Zika virus outbreaks. We will also continue our work on the effectiveness of lay-health worker interventions to treat common mental disorders (depression and anxiety), focusing particularly on treatment of these conditions among adolescents, in whom over half of mental health disorders start. 

Through the MRC Programme Grant, we leverage additional funding for research projects and support salaries for around 30 statisticians and epidemiologists, based at LSHTM. The grant is critical to enable us to recruit and retain these scientists, who have disease and methodological expertise in the design and analysis of epidemiological studies in LMICs. We collaborate with the MRC Units in The Gambia and Uganda, and over 50 other research institutes in LMICs. We will continue our initiatives to increase capacity in medical statistics in sub-Saharan Africa, for example by expanding the MRC TEG Fellowship scheme, which to date has trained 17 medical statisticians through a Masters in Medical Statistics at LSHTM, followed by a placement year. All are now working as medical statisticians in Africa.","2018-11-01","2023-10-31",4128086,"","","GBP","MRC","London Sch of Hygiene and Trop Medicine","United Kingdom","UNICEF, University of Nairobi, Malaria Consortium, WoMena, Uganda, University of Cape Town, National Hospital of Pneumo-Phtisiology, Ipsos-MORI, Harvard University, University of Makeni, University of Lusaka, Research Institute for Health Sciences (IRSS), University of Ibadan, University of Malawi, Kintampo Health Research Centre, Leiden University Medical Center, Africa Health Research Institute, Organization for Public Health Interventions and Development, Ifakara Health Institute, University of Oxford, KNCV Tuberculosis Foundation, National Institute for Medical Research, University of Ghana, University of Bristol, Centro de Investigação em Saúde de Manhiça, University of Jos, World Health Organization (WHO), University Medical Centre Utrecht, Kamuzu Central Hospital, University of East Anglia, Burnet Institute, University of Birmingham, Hiwot Fana Hospital, Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases (CRID), Mahidol University, University of Accra, University of Copenhagen, Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMS), University of Sussex, Wellcome Trust, Peekvsion, Ministry of Health and Child Welfare of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Ministry of Health, Uganda, Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust, The SHM Foundation, University College London, University Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar, University of Tours, National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy, Zambart, Christian Medical College Vellore, Aga Khan University, HealthRight International, University of Bordeaux I, Queen Mary, University of London, Government of Zimbabwe, Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM), Njala University, Sierra Leone, Cote D'Ivoire's National Institute of Public Health, MRC/UVRI Uganda Research Unit on AIDS, Pasteur Institute of Madagascar, Monash University, St George's University of London, Imperial College London, Sangath, Haramaya University, Stellenbosch University, Medical Research Council, Sophia University, Universidade de São Paulo, University of Bamako, Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation, University of Zimbabwe, Pasteur Institute, Morocco, Kenyan Institute for Medical Research (KEMRI), Biomedical Research and Training Inst, Royal Veterinary College, Johns Hopkins University","United States, Kenya, Uganda, United Kingdom, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Zambia, Nigeria, Malawi, Ghana, Netherlands, Tanzania, United Republic of, Tanzania, Australia, Thailand, Denmark, Ukraine, Pakistan, France, India, Ethiopia, Japan, Mali, Zimbabwe","GB-1-300347","FCDO fully funded","Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","","","Active",2021-07-29,"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=MR/R010161/1","300347",NA

Preparing for and responding to such threats is a priority for public health agencies and governments worldwide. Equally importantly, as scientific research delivers new approaches to controlling existing infectious diseases such as malaria, HIV, tuberculosis and polio, there is a need to determine what interventions are likely to work best to limit the disease and illness caused by a specific disease in a particular setting.

In this context, computer modelling of the spread of diseases in populations coupled with scientifically rigorous data analysis have proven themselves as powerful tools for giving insight into how diseases spread and what can be done to limit that control that spread. The Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis undertakes research on these scientific methods and applies them to disease threats of concern. 

A key feature of the Centre is the close links it has made with with public health agencies - such as the Public Health England, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US (CDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO) - organisations which have to formulate and implement strategies to control infectious diseases. 

Senior scientists in the Centre are world-leaders in infectious disease modelling and analysis. They have broad experience in responding to real epidemics, and undertaking epidemiological research on endemic diseases (such as malaria, HIV, tuberculosis and polio). Their work directly influences disease control policy through the many interactions the Centre has with public health organisations and governments. 

Funding provided by MRC and Imperial College has allowed dedicated investment into the development of close collaborative partnerships with PHE, CDC and WHO and governments and research centres in many low and middle income countries (LMICs). We also work closely with other important organisations who work on improving health in LMICs (notably the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The Global Fund and Gavi). With each, our collaborative research has both scientific interest to Centre researchers and contributes to the evidence base for public health decisions. Centre funding supports a core technical capacity available to all projects and pays for dedicated liaison staff who facilitate and enhance our partnerships with major global health organisations and LMICs. 

MRC funding has also facilitated a greater focus on collaboration, training and career development within the Centre - training the next generation of quantitative infectious disease epidemiologists. We are also involved in increasing knowledge of advanced modelling methods in public health institutions and the wider infectious disease research community, and so have run a large number of introductory short-courses and workshops (in 13 countries in the last 5 years)

This applied activity depends on more fundamental research undertaken in the Centre on the transmission dynamics of different diseases, how diseases evolve genetically over time, and on analysing new approaches to control or treat diseases. This research is interdisciplinary, with Centre researchers working with leading clinical and experimental scientists around the world.

Continued Centre funding will allow existing partnerships to be sustained and enhanced, and new collaborations with researchers and health agencies in LMICs to be developed. By supporting PhD training and postdoctoral career development, it will also continue to expand the UK skill base in mathematical modelling and advanced analysis applied to health problems. Last, continued MRC support will pump-prime new priority research areas, including work on improving the development of new vaccines and on tackling the global challenge posed by antimicrobial resistance.","2018-04-01","2023-03-31",4506171,"","","GBP","MRC","Imperial College London","United Kingdom","Imperial College London, Government of Brazil, UNICEF, University of Edinburgh, Public

"486","MR/R022151/1","United Kingdom, Indonesia","Improving Mental Health Literacy Among Young People aged 12-15 years in Indonesia: IMPeTUs","Mental health disorders account for 13% of the global burden of disease, and are estimated to affect 10-20% of children and adolescents worldwide. Depression is the leading cause of this mental health disability and affects 6% of adolescents globally each year. Research shows that the prevalence of depression rises sharply after puberty and that over half of depressed adolescents have a recurrent episode within five years. 

Adolescents account for almost one fifth of the total population in South-East Asia. Under-diagnosis and under-treatment of depression in adolescents is often higher than those in adult populations, leading to poorer health outcomes for this group. This is likely to be particularly problematic in low to middle income countries such as Indonesia, where limited resources and cultural norms reduce the likelihood of adolescents successfully seeking and obtaining appropriate treatment. 

Mental health literacy can be defined as knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders which help people to prevent, recognise and manage problems. We know that low levels of mental health literacy significantly increase the risk of adolescents developing moderate to severe depression and that improving mental health literacy may a useful way to reduce the burden of depression amongst children and adolescents. 

We are proposing a simple, low cost approach to improving mental health literacy in young people aged 12-15 years by developing a group of resources to be used in school and health settings. Adolescents express preference for peer and family support rather than professionally led services which indicates that our intervention may have considerable benefit for improving mental health literacy in this population. Our application arises directly from discussions with local people who identified a need to develop interventions to support mental health literacy amongst children and young people. 

Our study will be undertaken in four phases: 

In phase 1, a systematic review will identify the range of approaches that have been used to address mental health literacy and/or depression self-management in children and adolescents across South East Asia and identify those factors which may potentially influence the effectiveness of these approaches. 

In Phase 2, we will undertake qualitative interviews with a range of people (young people, service users, carers, professionals and other key stakeholders) incorporating photo elicitation methods to understand the perception of depression in children and adolescents in Java, Indonesia. 

In phase 3, we will use the findings from phases 1 and 2 and hold a series of workshops with local stakeholders to co-produce an evidence-based toolkit to promote mental health literacy and depression-focussed self-management in children and young people in Indonesia. 

Phase 4 will undertake nine implementation case studies in sites chosen to represent different levels of urbanisation and implementation pathways. We will implement our intervention in schools, CAMHS services and primary care services across three areas (Jakarta, Bogor and Magelang) and evaluate the impact, acceptability and feasibility of the prototype intervention. We will produce best practice evidence-based guidelines to optimise the use of this intervention in practice. 

Our project aims to improve depression-focussed mental health literacy amongst 12-15 year olds in Java, Indonesia. It will build research capacity and provide meaningful opportunities for 'user-focussed' research. We will develop a minimum of two subsequent grant applications, including a protocol to rigorously evaluate our prototype intervention, and assemble a strong Indonesia research group with the knowledge, skills and experience to undertake such a study.","2018-09-01","2021-12-28",302570,"","","GBP","MRC","University of Manchester","United Kingdom","University of Indonesia, Into The Light Indonesia","Indonesia","GB-1-300347","FCDO fully funded","Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office","","","Active",2021-07-29,"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=MR/R022151/1","300347",NA

What is needed is research which allows us to understand how these constraints interact. PEDL will pursue a range of approaches that promise to produce credible research results that will be useful for policy-making, supporting research related to private enterprises of all sizes, initially focused on four themes: modelling market frictions in LICs using newly available data, understanding how constraints interact using micro-founded macro models, the dynamics of SMEs - informality and entrepreneurship and the role of export-oriented industries in driving growth.

CLARE selected a group of recently closed or near to closing IDRC-supported research programs to further develop and scale their results for greater impact. The selected recipients are expected to participate in a mid-term learning review in late 2020 to reflect on their efforts to achieve scaling and research uptake.

One of these recipients is the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA). This project integrates results from CARIAA by supporting three initiatives in South Asia with strong potential for scaling or research uptake for greater impact.

The first initiative focuses on scaling adaptation trials to inform climate financing in Bangladesh. The research will build upon earlier CARIAA results to evaluate the suitability of a set of adaptation options and work with government departments to develop an adaptation funding proposal to invest in and scale promising strategies and increase resilience in coastal Bangladesh. 

The second initiative focuses on reducing the health risks of rising temperatures in India. The team will follow up on CARIAA pilot studies to assess the effectiveness of the first year of India’s heat stress warning campaign. Working with the Indian Meteorological Department, it will prepare tailored heat stress advice for 50 rural villages. 

The third initiative will identify pathways for climate-resilient development in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region. The team will map outcomes, explore the effectiveness of livelihood innovations piloted in four countries under CARIAA, and critically examine the opportunities for scaling, creating climate resilient development pathways, and integrating promising strategies into adaptation planning.

Expected results include contributions to knowledge through peer-reviewed publications, contributions to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report, policy-oriented outputs, and practice through strategic engagement and research-into-use activities. It will also strengthen collaboration amongst the network of researchers previously engaged in CARIAA.

The study will aim to measure the age-specific seroprevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at 3 time points, each 6 months apart. Age-specific incidence estimates will be applied to the census population to obtain numbers of infections in the population at each time point. These estimates will be compared with external data on COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths in each setting, to calculate age-specific infection-hospitalisation and infection-fatality ratios. SARS-CoV-2 antibody kinetics will be defined by studying changes in antibody titres over time. Risk factors for infection will be studied by comparing SARS-CoV-2 seroconverters and non-seroconverters with respect to epidemiological exposures. This study will provide crucial information regarding population exposure and SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, and will provide a complete picture of the relationship between clinically apparent and asymptomatic infections.

Almost 100% of patients showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in their lungs by chest CT scans indicating acute lung injury (ALI). Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanism(s) of ALI induced by SARS-CoV-2 is very important to inform vaccine safety and immunotherapeutic strategies. In this proposal, we will investigate the host immune responses and their association with severity of ALI in patient samples and animal models. We will bring together a team of experts with complementary expertise including immunopathology in coronavirus infections, up-to-date lab technologies, and know-how to ensure the feasibility of this study with the following goals: 
1)    defining SARS-CoV-2 specific serum profiles (epitopes) using yeast display antigen library
2)    determining antibody functions including antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) vs neutralizing activities in vitro assays
3)    studying T cell (CD4 and CD8) responses to whole SARS-CoV-2 genome
4)    evaluating ALI in response to live SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without passive immunity (antibody or T cells) generated from vaccine candidates in a humanized mice model.

Older and disabled people are the groups with highest mortality rates from COVID-19. Hygiene-related behaviour change (HBC) programmes must therefore include older and people with disabilities. However, these groups may face challenges protecting themselves from infection (e.g. reliance on carers, lack of accessible information, lower autonomy, lower socio-economic status, and inaccessible sanitation facilities). HBC programmes may need to implement additional activities to reach these groups. Yet, guidance on the inclusion of people with disabilities and older people in COVID-related HBC programmes is still evolving, and practical advice is needed.
The PENDA programme will conduct an action-research project to support FCDO's Hygiene and Behaviour Change Consortium (HBCC) to include people with disabilities and older people in their COVID-19 response.
